# linux-multithreaded-grep-runner

<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
This project is my implementation of a Linux-based parallelized <code>grep</code> runner in C. Specifically, it involves multithreading where <code>1-8</code> "workers" could be used. 
The project was submitted as a requirement for the <strong>CS 140 (Operating Systems)</strong> Course of the Department of Computer Science in the University of the Philippines - Diliman during the First Semester of A.Y. 2022 - 2023.
